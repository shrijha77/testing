Workspaces in VSCode are super useful. 
They can have their own settings and seperate your projects in a way that each commit doesnâ€™t impact other projects.

go to File > Save Workspace as and go to the folder that you are currently working on.

Make Your First Commit to Github
All you need to do it push something to Github from VSCode is:

Save the changes you made to your file;
Commit to the Master Branch;
Push to Github.
